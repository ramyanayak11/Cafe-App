A simulation of an online ordering system for a coffee shop.

First we run User.java, as the main method is within the User class. From there, you can interact with the application through the console. Customers can order items from a menu, customize drinks, and pay in cash. Staff can add new items, edit existing items, and remove items from the menu.
